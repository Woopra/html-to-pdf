##Status
Curently works but deplo9yemnt is broken.  when in docker, chrome fails with error:

`Fontconfig warning: "/etc/fonts/fonts.conf", line 146: blank doesn't take any effect anymore. please remove it from your fonts.conf`

Then it makes an illegible output.  This was fixed inthe past but the commit was lost when a machine was exchanged.
